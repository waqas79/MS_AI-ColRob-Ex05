üêõ Task 1.1 ‚Äì Locust Simulation (Basic)
Goal

Simulate N=50 locusts moving around a circular arena (circumference C=0.5).

Each locust moves either left (-v) or right (+v) with speed 0.01.

Each timestep:

Locusts may switch direction spontaneously with probability P=0.15.

Locusts may also switch if they detect that the majority of neighbors within range r=0.045 move the opposite way.

We track their positions and directions over time.

Plan

Initialize locusts:

Random positions (0‚ÄìC).

Random directions (¬±1).

Update each timestep:

Move position: pos = (pos + dir * v) % C.

With probability P, flip direction.

Otherwise check neighbors: if majority moves opposite ‚Üí flip.

Store:

Positions and directions at each step.

Number of left-goers L.

Animate:

Show locusts as dots moving on a ring (unwrapped as a line [0,C]).

Color by direction (red = left, blue = right).

Also plot L(t) live as animation.
